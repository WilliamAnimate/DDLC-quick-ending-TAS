# Welcome to the lab!

This folder is where i store all the files i use to test my DDLC installation.

## file names and meanings

**s.bat** - renames ``s`` back to ``sayori.chr``, so you don't have to

**test.bat** - deletes firstrun and renames ``s`` to ``sayori.chr``, if test.exe exists, it runs that, otherwise, it runs main.exe

**deletefirstrun.bat** - deletes the ``firstrun`` file inside the ``game`` directory

# ddlc quick ending tas

###### challenging C++ developers since 2023.
<!-- seriously, if you make super optimized code, try to beat me in time :skull: -->

crappy rust TAS for the [quick ending](https://doki-doki-literature-club.fandom.com/wiki/Possible_Endings#Quick_Ending) for [Doki Doki Literature Club](https://ddlc.moe).

## [demo, and my own run of this game with this TAS.](https://youtu.be/1UQSrYjjNHs)

> Maybe you don't know what DDLC is, you should play it at nights when you just want to burn time ;)

I don't have ddlc plus, but this code *should* work the same.

## Features

- Automagically skips the content warning at the beginning of the game, but we probably not allowed to modify saves so like wh

- It works out of the box, just put it where DDLC is located.

## Getting started (user)

1: download ddlc quick ending tas.

2: put it in ddlc's directory, if you don't have the game, download it.

3: run it.

4: make sure to record it and upload it to [youtube.com](https://youtube.com) and get 9999999999 subscribers for your TAS.

> **Note**: for best time, it is recommended to run the game on a **HIGH END** machine, where the game is on your **SSD** or a **RAMDISK**.

## Getting started (developer)

1: Obtain a rust compiler, for this project, I used ``rustc`` because this is a single file and I don't need cargo, as dependencies don't matter

2: Make your changes.

3: ``cargo build --release`` or run ``build.bat``

4: Make sure to record your new and improved TAS and upload it to [youtube.com](https://youtube.com) and get 9999999999 subscribers for **your** TAS.

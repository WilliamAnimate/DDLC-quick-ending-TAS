> The video is only slow because I am running the game on my HDD + DDLC is made using python.

<!-- > Maybe you don't know what DDLC is, you should play it at nights when you just want to burn time ;) -->

I don't have ddlc plus, but this code *should* work the same.

## Getting started (user)

1: download ddlc quick ending tas.

2: put it in ddlc's directory, if you don't have the game, download it.

3: run it.

4: make sure to record it and upload it to [youtube.com](https://youtube.com) and get 9999999999 subscribers for your TAS.

> **Note**: for best time, it is recommended to run the game on a **HIGH END** machine, where the game is on your **SSD**.

<!-- > **Warning**: this won't get you on the leaderboards, if you're a developer, you should try writing this in c or assembly :) -->

## Getting started (developer)

1: Obtain a rust compiler, for this project, I used ``rustc`` because this is a single file and I don't need cargo, as dependencies don't matter

2: Make your changes.

3: ``rustc main.rs`` or run ``build.bat``

4: Make sure to record your new and improved TAS and upload it to [youtube.com](https://youtube.com) and get 9999999999 subscribers for **your** TAS.
